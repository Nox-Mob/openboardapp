# OpenBoardApp integration

What Board publishes for OpenAppHub and the other apps (SHARED-SPEC §3.6). Everything here is a
**read-only view** in schema `board`, created `with (security_invoker = true)`: it runs with the
caller's own row security, so a person sees exactly the rows they could read in Board itself
(members of the organization; nobody else; signed-out visitors nothing).

Rules for consumers:

- **Feature-detect.** On a database without Board (or before migration `0002`), the views don't
  exist. Treat "relation does not exist" (PostgREST `42P01` / `PGRST205`) as "Board isn't here" and
  hide the integration.
- **Never write.** Board exposes no write paths to other apps yet. A change in Board would go
  through a `security invoker` RPC documented here.
- **Columns are stable.** New columns are added at the end; none is removed or renamed.

Migration: [`db/migrations/0002_integration_views.sql`](../db/migrations/0002_integration_views.sql).
Tests: [`db/tests/60_integration_views.sql`](../db/tests/60_integration_views.sql).

## `board.api_meetings`

order by meeting_date limit 1;
```

## `board.api_decisions`

## `board.add_report_to_meeting(p_meeting, p_title, p_file_name, p_source_app)` (S-13)

The one write path other apps use: adds a report (PDF) to an upcoming meeting's documents, where the
meeting's Packet tab lists it for the packet. `security invoker`: only people who can edit Board's
records (owner, admin, chair, secretary), only while Board is writable, only for meetings that
haven't happened yet. Returns `document_id` and `storage_path`; the caller uploads the PDF to that
path in the `board-files` bucket (Board's storage rules allow the same people). The shared helper
`addReportToBoardMeeting` and the `AddToBoardPackage` button (OpenAppHub `shared/`) do both steps.

## Board members in sync with OpenCharterApp (S-14)

For organizations that use both apps, OpenCharterApp's officers at the organization level are
OpenBoardApp terms too (migration `0005_charter_sync.sql`, with OpenCharterApp's `0005`):

- **Charter → Board.** Appointing, changing or ending an officer in Charter inserts, updates or
  ends the matching term here (`source = 'charter'`, `source_id` = the appointment). Existing
  officers were copied once when the migration ran.
- **Board → Charter.** A term added here becomes a Charter appointment when its position matches one
  of the organization's seats in Charter (by title) and its person matches a member there (by login,
  else by name). Otherwise it stays Board-only.
- **Linked terms** can't be renamed, moved or deleted here; setting an end date of today or earlier
  ends the appointment in Charter (Charter's rules and permissions apply, or the change is refused).
- The two sides use the transaction setting `oah.syncing` so they don't echo each other.

**An exception to SHARED-SPEC §3.6, on purpose:** `board.sync_term_from_charter` and Charter's
`appointment_from_board` / `end_appointment_from_board` are `security definer` functions that only
the other app's triggers call (execute is revoked from every client role). They run only after a
write the source app already allowed, and the Charter-side ones go through Charter's own
`appoint_officer` / `end_appointment` checks. `security invoker` RPCs would refuse a Charter admin
who isn't also a Board editor and leave the two apps out of step.

A two-app check (both apps' migrations on one database) is in `db/suite/charter_sync.sql`; it isn't
part of CI, which builds Board alone.
